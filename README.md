# Semantic-Segmentation-of-Full-body-MRI-using-FCN-
Procedure to excecte the Convolution_Fully_Network.py. 
Set the training folder and Validation folder that contains subfolder Images & Annotations in each.
Set the Model folder to where the vgg weights are going to be downloaded.
Finally set the logs_dir and then Prediction_dir where the test results are going to be saved.
The code can handle images of any size. 
Important imformation - Make sure the images and its respectve annotations are the same size. 
Now the implementation only includes the segmentation of muscles. Soon will update segmentation of Adipose tissue, Bone & Organs. 
The results file consists of few examples of successful segmentation. The results are after just few epoch training of the model. Will update soon with better results.
